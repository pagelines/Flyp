== Description ==

Flyp lets you make cards that flip over (front and back)

== Changelog ==

= 1.7 =
* Now able to create square-shaped cards (.row-squared). Note: at some screen widths, square shape is abandoned for rectangle shape for better display (part of DMS core styling).
* Tip: to create circle-shaped cards, use .row-squared and then set "Flyp Card Border Radius / Rounded Corners" to something like 2000px (will create ovals when not using square-shaped cards).
* Fix so border-radius works even if no border is used.
* Fix for when border color was set at per-card level but not also at main level.
* Updated art.

= 1.6 =
* Fix for Mac Firefox v30 displaying front image on back of card when both sides had images. Props Chris Johnston.

= 1.5 =
* Fix for setting per-card color overrides. Now works.

= 1.4 =
* Changed default border radius from 2px to 0px (was previously not possible to remove border radius (i.e. rounded corners) while also having a border color). If you had the default 2px, just add in "2" and you'll get it back.
* Changed inputs from 'text' to 'text_small' (option type only works in DMS 2).

= 1.3 =
* Removed small bit of styling now that it's been added into DMS 2.0.5

= 1.2 =
* Added option to remove the space / gap / margin between cards (only DMS 2) -- i.e. "Tight Cards". Example screenshot added to PageLines.com/Shop.
* Flyp can now also be a full-width section (only DMS 2)

= 1.1.1 =
* Added proper version numbering so auto-updates work. It's recommended to see the v1.1 update notes too.

= 1.1 =
* Fix for setting columns (no hard-coded option defaults).
* Changed "advanced" overrides from check to select option types (will need to re-save the option).

= 1.0 =
* Initial release.
